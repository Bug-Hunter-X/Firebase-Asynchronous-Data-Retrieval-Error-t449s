The following Firebase code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to data retrieval and asynchronous operations:

```javascript
// Incorrect asynchronous handling
db.ref('users').once('value', (snapshot) => {
  const users = snapshot.val();
  // Assuming this is the code that causes the error later on
  console.log(users.someUser.someProperty); //Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'someUser')
});
```

The issue lies in the unpredictable nature of asynchronous operations within the `once` callback. The `console.log` statement attempts to access `users.someUser.someProperty` before the `snapshot.val()` data is fully loaded. If `someUser` or `someProperty` is not present, this leads to a runtime error. This is particularly problematic when dealing with deeply nested objects.
