# Firebase Asynchronous Data Retrieval Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications involving asynchronous data retrieval. The bug occurs due to accessing nested properties of a dataset before the data is fully loaded from Firebase's Realtime Database.

## Bug Description
The provided JavaScript code uses Firebase's `once` method to retrieve data.  However, it attempts to access nested object properties before checking if these properties actually exist in the retrieved data. This often leads to a `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...'` error.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully checking for the existence of nested properties before accessing them. This ensures that the code doesn't throw an error when a property is unexpectedly missing.  The solution demonstrates how to safely access nested objects using optional chaining (?.) and the nullish coalescing operator (??).
